# bslib_demo_shiny

This R Shiny demo relies on R Shiny modules and the following packages for "Sassy" CSS styling:

* [bslib](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/)
  * {bslib} introduces Sass variables to Shiny making the customization process more unified and easier than the traditional _custom.css_
  * Please reference www/styles.scss to inspect my custom Sassy CSS file
* [thematic](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/)
  * {thematic} provides a centralized approach to styling R graphics, particularly grubs and ggplot2 visualizations
